Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in IT security at the University of Salerno. Passionate about penetration testing and mobile and web application development.

In my free time I love to immerse myself in nature with mountain walks, dedicate myself to role-playing games and reading manga, and experiment with new recipes in the kitchen, combining relaxation and creativity.
